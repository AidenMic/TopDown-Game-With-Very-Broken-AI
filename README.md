# TopDown-Game-With-Very-Broken-AI

I made this during my first game jam when I was a freshman.  I was working alone and I was not very experienced and it shows.  It was also uploaded compiled here:  https://vegas242.itch.io/dont-try-this-at-home

It's a top down game where you move with wasd or the arrow keys, throw wrenches with left mouse click and drop bombs with right mouse click.  There are enemies that teleport all over the place because I only halfway understood how pathing worked.  The sprites and animations were used from Spriter, which I'm actually not certain if I'm allowed to upload those, so I started to remake them, but I realized I don't have time right now and I don't think BrashMonkey will care that much.
